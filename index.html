        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is a simple text box created with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this box is to provide a basic structure for your website content. You can add more text, images, links, and other elements to build out your site. This text box is styled to have a nice border, some padding, and a little bit of shadow to make it stand out from the background.</p>
        <p>Feel free to modify the styles and content to fit your needs. This is just a starting point to help you get started with creating a more visually appealing webpage.</p>
