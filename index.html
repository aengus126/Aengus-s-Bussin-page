        <h1>Aengus Patterson</h1>
        <p>I'm very greedy and I like to put my name everywhere I can. My real website is aenguspatterson.com</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I won't leave you with nothing though. Here is some of my advice: </p>
        <p>Don't let 5 bad minutes ruin an entire day.</p>
        <p>Respect people. There is never a reason to be a dick.</p>
        <p>Nothing is ever akward until somebody says it is.</p>
        <p>Speak more. Expose yourself more. And own everything you do.</p>
        <p>Don't overthink anything.</p>
