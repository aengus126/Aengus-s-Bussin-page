        <p>hi is a simple text box created with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this box is to provide a basic structure for your website content. You can add more text, images, links, and other elements to build out your site. This text box is styled to have a nice border, some padding, and a little bit of shadow to make it stand out from the background.</p>
